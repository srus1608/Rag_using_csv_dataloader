## 📊🔍 RAG-based CSV QA System 🤖
Ask intelligent questions from your CSV data! 🚀 This Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project allows users to query CSV datasets and get AI-generated answers — perfect for analyzing large spreadsheets and data files in seconds!

## ⚙️ How It Works
📂 CSV Upload: Upload CSV files containing structured data.
🧹 Preprocessing: Data is cleaned and converted into textual chunks.
🧠 Embedding Generation: Each chunk is embedded for vector storage.
🗄️ PostgreSQL Storage: Store embeddings in Postgres for efficient searching.
💬 Question Answering: Retrieve relevant data and generate AI responses.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
Python 🐍
HTML, CSS, JavaScript 🎨 (Frontend)
PostgreSQL 🐘 (for storing embeddings)
LangChain 🦜🔗 (RAG pipeline)
LLMs (OpenAI, Llama2, etc.) for response generation

## ✨ Features
✅ Ask natural language questions directly from CSV data.
✅ Clean, fast, and efficient CSV parsing.
✅ Interactive web interface.
✅ Robust backend with PostgreSQL for high performance.
